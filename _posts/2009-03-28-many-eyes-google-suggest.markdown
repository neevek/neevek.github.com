Visualising results from Google suggest.

I've been meaning to play around with the [google suggest api](http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2006-08-17-n22.html) 
for quite a while, and was also quite curious about IBM's collaborative visualisation platform 
[many eyes](http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/). 

Google suggest has been around for a long time (as part of Google labs), but only recently got 
integrated by default into Google search (["At a loss for
words?"](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/at-loss-for-words.html)). It's a fascinating data source, because it 
reflects how (at least the majority) of users interact with Google. See 
["An Expirement (sic) with Google Suggest"](http://digg.com/tech_news/An_Expirement_with_Google_Suggest) for some
 (sometimes scary) examples.

I wrote a small [ruby script](http://github.com/jberkel/playground/tree/master/suggest_tree) to recursively get a list 
of popular queries, starting of with some simple questions like "why is..." / "how do...", then fed the data into
 the [word tree](http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/page/Word_Tree.html) visualisation provided by many eyes.

Here are some examples, with comments (clicking on an image will take you to the interactive visualisation):

What really surprised me here was that *most* of the places people try to get to appear to be situated in virtual/game worlds
(Super Mario / WoW ...?). So "how do you get to howling fjord" I hear you ask. It's really easy, just follow the Grizzly Hills, it's
behind there, situated in southeastern Northrend.

Love, pregnancy, failed marriages & dogs. C'est la vie!
