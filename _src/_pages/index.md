Hey, I have just finished my new open source project [Minerl](https://github.com/neevek/minerl) - a static site generator written in Perl, which is also easy to be used with Github Pages. If that sounds interesting to you, go and check out this post: [Introduction to Minerl](/posts/2013/06/27/introduction-to-minerl.html).
